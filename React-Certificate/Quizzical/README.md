# Quizzical

**Quizzical** is a solo project I built as the final project at the end of Scrimba’s React course.  
It brings together everything I learned throughout the course into one build, applying **React fundamentals, state management, API integration, and conditional rendering** in a single app.  

The app fetches multiple-choice questions from the **Open Trivia Database API**, challenges the user to answer them, and provides instant feedback with scoring.
