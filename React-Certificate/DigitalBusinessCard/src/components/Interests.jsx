            <h3>My Interests</h3>
            <p>Outside of coding, I've been playing soccer for over 15 years, and 
                it's one of my biggest passions. I also enjoy spending quality time 
                with my family and hitting the gym to stay active and focused. I'm 
                always inspired by creative projects people have built with code, 
                and I love exploring new ideas and tools that push the boundaries 
                of whatâ€™s possible. Seeing what others have made motivates me to 
                keep learning and creating my own.</p>
