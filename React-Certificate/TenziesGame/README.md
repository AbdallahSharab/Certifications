# Tenzies Game

**Tenzies** is a React-based game built as one of the **capstone projects in Scrimba’s React course**.  
It was a **guided, step-by-step project**, where each part had to be completed before moving forward. The structured format made it hands-on and ensured that all core React concepts were applied in practice.  

The project ties together everything I learned in the React course — from components and props, to hooks, state management, conditional rendering, and side effects.

## Game Play
- As soon as the game loads, a **timer begins**.  
- The goal: make all **10 dice show the same number** as quickly as possible.  
- Click dice to “hold” them at their current value.  
- Re-roll the rest as many times as needed until all 10 match.  
- Win → timer stops and the game celebrates your victory.  
- Replay → reset the dice and start again to beat your best time.
