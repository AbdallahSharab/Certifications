# Digital Businness Card

**Digital Business Card** is a solo project I built as part of Scrimba’s React course.  
The project was a great way to practice **React fundamentals** while building a sleek, responsive business card for the web.  
It worked really well as an introduction to **breaking a UI into components**, since each section of the card could be built and managed separately.
