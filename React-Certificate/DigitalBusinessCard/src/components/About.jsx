            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I’m a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Alberta 
                exploring the world of Full-Stack Development. I’ve gained experience with 
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, and I’m continuing to expand my 
                skills by building modern, responsive web interfaces. I also have a strong 
                foundation in other languages like Python, C, C++, and Bash, which supports 
                my growth as a versatile developer.</p>
