# Assembly EndGame

**Assembly Endgame** is a creative spin on the classic Hangman game, built as the **capstone project at the end of Scrimba’s React course**.  
It was a **guided project**, broken into a series of challenges where each step built on the last. To move forward, I had to solve every challenge before advancing to the next, which made the process very hands-on while still providing guidance when needed.

Instead of a traditional hangman, players have **11 programming languages** representing their lives. Each wrong guess eliminates one language with a playful farewell message, until only **Assembly** remains.

## Game Play
- Start with **11 programming languages** (JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Each incorrect guess removes one language from the list.  
- A custom farewell message appears for each eliminated language.  
- Win by guessing the word before you lose all languages.  
- Lose → You’re left coding in **Assembly** .  
- On winning, enjoy a celebratory **confetti animation** and a “New Game” button.
